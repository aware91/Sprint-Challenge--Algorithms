## Exercise I

a)O(n^3), a will continue to grow until it satisfies the conditions of n _ n _ n


b)O(n^2), a nested loop


c)O(n), recursively called until conditions of n bunnies is met, it also could stop immediately and start at 0, or eventually become 0


## Exercise II

Well for 1, I would
floorsChecked = []
minFloor = 0
in floor in range of f drop and egg, if egg is broken minFloor - 1 else if egg is not broken minFloor + 1
return minFloor
I would have this loop going from 0 until f, the minFloor will return the max floor they could drop from
